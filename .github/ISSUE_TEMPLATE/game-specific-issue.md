> [!IMPORTANT]
> PartyDeck includes an Add Game wizard that can be used to quickly and easily add your own games to the launcher. Many games work out-of-the-box simply by adding them through this wizard and don't actually need a handler package. Only submit this issue if you have already tried adding your game through the wizard or downloaded an existing handler package and are experiencing problems with the game.

**PCGamingWiki Article**
Search your game on PCGamingWiki, and put a link to the article here. PCGW articles contain lots of info that may help with troubleshooting.

**Additional info**
Describe any errors or problems you came across when trying to run the game. Attach relevant media like screenshots or videos if needed.

**Logs**
Posting logs can be super helpful with troubleshooting. If you're launching PartyDeck from the gaming mode launcher script, it should create a `log.txt` file next to the executable. If you're launching from desktop, run the launcher from a terminal and copy-paste the output.
