## Features

- Runs multiple instances of a game at a time and automatically tiles up to 4 game windows per monitor
- Supports native Linux games as well as Windows games through Proton-GE/UMU Launcher
- Handler system that tells the launcher how to handle game files, meaning very little manual setup is required
- Steam multiplayer API is emulated, allowing for multiple instances of Steam games
- Works with most game controllers without any additional setup, drivers, or third-party software
- Now works with multiple keyboards and mice!
- Now supports launching the instances across multiple monitors when using the SDL gamescope backend!
- Uses sandboxing software to mask out controllers so that each game instance only detects the controller assigned to it, preventing input interference
- Profile support allows each player to have their own persistent save data, settings, and stats for games
- Works out of the box on SteamOS

## Installing & Usage

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/wunnr/partydeck-rs/releases) and extract it into a folder. Download game handlers [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/D9HBKM18YR#zG8XC8yVy9WL).

### SteamOS

SteamOS includes all of PartyDeck's dependencies, but you will need to be on SteamOS 3.7.0 or above for the splitscreen script to work.

If you're in desktop mode, simply run the `partydeck` executable. To use PartyDeck in Gaming Mode, add `GamingModeLauncher.sh` as a shortcut to Steam, and in the settings for that shortcut disable Steam Input.

### Bazzite Deck

Bazzite 44 stable is built on GLIBC_2.42. To use PartyDeck, rebase to testing for your hardware and reboot:

```
# For AMD/Intel builds
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-deck:testing

# For Nvidia builds
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-deck-nvidia:testing

# Reboot
systemctl reboot
```

*Bazzite 45 will release around October 2026, removing the need to do this*

### Desktop Linux

PartyDeck's splitscreen tiling script requires KDE Plasma 6.0 and up; if you're on an older version of Plasma or not running Plasma at all, you can run PartyDeck without the script, but then it's up to you to resize and reposition the game windows yourself. You'll also need to install, Gamescope, Bubblewrap, and Fuse-overlayfs using your distro's package manager. Then, simply run the `partydeck` executable to get started. 

### Getting Started
Once in the main menu, click the + button to add a game, or click the button with the down arrow icon to import a PartyDeck Handler package (.pd2). Create profiles if you want to store save data, and have a look through the settings menu.

## Building

You'll need a Rust toolchain with the 2024 Edition. For building the mouse/keyboard gamescope fork, you'll also need `meson` and `ninja` installed.

Clone the repo and initialise submodules:

```
git clone https://github.com/partydeck/partydeck.git
cd partydeck
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
```

Then build with:

```
cargo build --release
```

If built with download deps, the build script downloads the latest releases of Goldberg Steam Emu and UMU Launcher from GitHub. The output binary and bundled dependencies are placed in `target/release/`.

### Build feature flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `download_deps` | off | Downloads Goldberg Steam Emu and UMU Launcher from GitHub releases with known good versions|
| `download_deps_latest` | off | Downloads Goldberg Steam Emu and UMU Launcher from GitHub releases with latest available |
| `build_gamescope` | off | Builds the mouse/keyboard gamescope fork from the submodule (requires `meson` and `ninja`) |

**Build with gamescope:**

```
cargo build --release -F build_gamescope
```

**Download known dependancies:**

```
cargo build --release -F download_deps
```


## How it Works

PartyDeck uses a few software layers to provide a console-like split-screen gaming experience:

- **KWin Session:** This KWin Session displays all running game instances and runs a script to automatically resize and reposition each Gamescope window.
- **Gamescope:** Contains each instance of the game to its own window. Also has the neat side effect of receiving controller input even when the window is not currently active, meaning multiple Gamescope instances can all receive input simultaneously
- **Bubblewrap:** Uses bindings to mask out evdev input files from the instances, so each instance only receives input from one specific controller. Also uses directory binding to give each player their own save data and settings within the games.
- **Runtime (Steam Runtime/Proton):** If needed, the app can run native Linux games through a Steam Runtime (currently, 1.0 (scout) and 2.0 (soldier) are supported) for better compatibility. Windows games are launched through UMU Launcher.
- **Goldberg Steam Emu:** On games that use the Steam API for multiplayer, Goldberg is used to allow the game instances to connect to each other, as well as other devices running on the same LAN.
- **And finally, the game itself.**

## Known Issues, Limitations and To-dos

- AppImages and Flatpaks are not supported yet for native Linux games. Handlers can only run regular executables inside folders.
- Controller navigation support in the launcher is super primitive; I'd love to try making a more controller-friendly, Big-Picture-style UI in the future, but have no immediate plans for it.
- Games using Goldberg might have trouble discovering LAN games from other devices. If this happens, you can try adding a firewall rule for port 47584. If connecting two Steam Decks through LAN, their hostnames should be changed from the default "steamdeck".
